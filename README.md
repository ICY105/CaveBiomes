Warning: This project generates new caves in existing chunks, and may damage underground structures you have built. It is highly recommended to install in a new world. If you add it to an existing world, take a backup first!

# CaveBiomes
A Minecraft Datapack that adds 34 new cave biomes to improve the look and feel of the underground, including:

* Improved vanilla caves
* Underground Forest Caves
* Obsidian Caves
* Granite, Andesite, and Diroite Caves
* Ice Caves
* Prismarine Caves
* Regular & Red Sandstone Caves
* Terracotta caves of various colors
* Quartz Caves
* And some other special caves, but you'll have to find those on your own ;)

Some caves are dependant on the surface biome (ie. Ice Caves only spawn on cold biomes), so look out for those!
