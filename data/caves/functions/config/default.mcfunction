### Normal Caves

# There are 2 settings: weight and height.
# Weight- Range:[0..100] Affects how common a biome is. Setting to 0 prevents the biome from generating.
# Height- Range:[1..255] Affects how high a biome will generate. Higher numbers increase lag. Set to 255 for amplified world fun.
#
# Some caves are also biome dependent. This cannot currently be configured.
